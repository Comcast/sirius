<h1>Technical Overview</h1>

<p>
At Comcast, our applications need convenient, low-latency access to
important <em>reference datasets</em>. For example,
our <a href="http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/">XfinityTV</a> websites and
apps need to use entertainment-related data to serve almost every API
or web request to our datacenters: information like what
year <em>Casablanca</em> was released, or how many episodes were in
Season 7 of <em>Seinfeld</em>, or when the next episode of the Voice
will be airing (and on which channel!).</p>

<p>We traditionally managed this information with a combination of
  relational databases and RESTful web services but yearned for
  something simpler than the ORM, HTTP client, and cache management
  code our developers dealt with on a daily basis. As main memory
  sizes on commodity servers continued to grow, however, we asked
  ourselves:
<blockquote>
How can we keep this reference data entirely in RAM, while ensuring it
gets updated as needed and is easily accessible to application developers?
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>The Sirius distributed system library is our answer to that question, and 
  we're happy to announce that we've made it available as
  an <a href="http://comcast.github.io/sirius/">open source
  project</a>. Sirius is written in Scala and uses the Akka actor
  system under the covers, but is easily usable by any JVM-based
  language.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Sirius offers developers the following combination of
  properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Simple and semantically transparent interface</strong> for
  application developers, including the freedom to use arbitrary,
  native data structures for the in-memory representation of the
  reference data.</li>
<li><strong>Eventually consistent, near real-time replication</strong>
  of reference data updates, even across wide-area networks between
  datacenters.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence management</strong> and <strong>automated
    recovery</strong> after application restarts.
</ul>

<p>
In short, Sirius gives you access to your reference data with
arbitrary, native data structures while handling the distributed system
heavy lifting for you.
</p>

<h2>System Architecture</h2>

<p>Sirius is built around a model where an external
  system of record (or an intermediate) is responsible for <em>publishing</em>
  updates into an application cluster. This push-based model inverts
  the usual pull-based model and provides two major benefits: (1) a
  simple library interface; and (2) easy degradation&mdash;if the
  publisher becomes unavailable the application still has access to a
  (temporarily) stale mirror of the dataset.</p>

<img src="images/arch-diagram.png" alt="System diagram showing overall flow of events"/>

<p>The overall flow is shown in the diagram above. When an application
  receives an update, it hands the update off to Sirius as either a
  &quot;PUT&quot; or &quot;DELETE&quot;&mdash;Sirius provides a
  straightforward key-value interface. Sirius then uses the Paxos
  protocol to assign the update a globally consistent sequence number
  and ensure it gets replicated to all cluster members; updates are
  also recorded in local transaction logs. Finally, Sirius invokes a
  callback, one update at a time, to let the application know it can
  update its in-memory mirror (affectionately called the application's
  &quot;brain&quot; by our developers). This same callback is used
  when replaying a log to rebuild the application's brain at startup
  time.</p>

<p>On the read path, the application can simply read directly from the
  native data structures in its brain, providing convenient,
  low-latency access.</p>

<h2>Replication</h2>
<p>Sirius also provides a mechanism for very flexible replication topologies.
Our implementation includes a catch-up protocol to allow
  participating cluster members to retrieve missing updates from other
  nodes (whether due to lost messages or because a server was offline
  temporarily). We are able to re-use this same protocol to provide
  for passive cluster members that do not participate in Paxos but
  rather just play the role of "fast followers." Sirius cluster members
are currently statically configured; if a server finds its address in
the list of cluster members, it participates in the Paxos protocol,
but if it doesn't, it becomes a follower.
</p>

<img src="images/replication.png" alt="sample cluster architecture illustrating some of the possible replication topologies"/>


<p>
For example, consider the example shown above showing four different
clusters (possibly in different datacenters) labeled A-D. Clusters, A,
B, and C could all have the same configuration containing just the
servers in cluster A. This causes cluster A to run Paxos, but the
members of clusters B and C to periodically catch up from randomly
selected members of A. Meanwhile, cluster D could be configured with a
membership list containing all the members of clusters B and C; this
will cause the D nodes to catch up from randomly selected members of
both clusters (even though neither of them is actually the primary
Paxos cluster).
</p>
<p>
Sirius thus lets you set up very a very flexible mesh of replication
so that you could scale a Paxos &quot;ingest&quot; cluster separately
from clusters that serve clients directly&mdash;possibly even
different applications with a need for the same reference dataset.
</p>


<h2>Operational Experiences</h2>

<p>Multiple teams and products within Comcast have been using
  Sirius-enabled applications in production since August
  2012&mdash;nearly two years with relatively few problems. Sirius was
  designed to be operationally friendly from the beginning and
  includes:
<ul>
<li>automatic compaction and management of the local transaction
  logs</li>
<li>command-line tools for working with the logs</li>
<li>automatic registration of operational metrics via JMX if provided
  with an MBean server</li>
<li>graceful degradation during many types of failures and automatic recovery
  afterwards</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We've written a
  detailed <a href="https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/wiki/Getting+started+with+Sirius">Getting
  Started Guide</a> that includes a
  simple <a href="https://github.com/Comcast/sirius-reference-app">reference
