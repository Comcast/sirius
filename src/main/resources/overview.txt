Sirius is a library for distributing and coordinating data updates
amongst a cluster of nodes. It handles building an absolute ordering 
for updates that arrive in the cluster, ensuring that cluster nodes 
eventually receive all updates, and persisting the updates on each 
node. These updates are generally used to build in-memory data 
structures on each node, allowing applications using Sirius to have 
direct access to native data structures representing up-to-date data. 
Sirius does not, however, build these data structures itself -- 
instead, the client application supplies a callback handler, which 
allows developers using Sirius to build whatever structures are most 
appropriate for their application.

Said another way: Sirius enables a cluster of nodes to keep developer-
controlled in-memory data structures eventually consistent, allowing 
I/O-free access to shared information.
