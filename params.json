{"name":"Sirius","tagline":"Distributed system library for consistently replicating application reference data","body":"# Sirius\r\n\r\n![travis-build](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/Comcast/sirius.png?token=zSLLF7swbFqkKtu21hCs)\r\n\r\nSirius is a library for distributing and coordinating data updates\r\namongst a cluster of nodes. It handles building an absolute ordering\r\nfor updates that arrive in the cluster, ensuring that cluster nodes\r\neventually receive all updates, and persisting the updates on each\r\nnode. These updates are generally used to build in-memory data\r\nstructures on each node, allowing applications using Sirius to have\r\ndirect access to native data structures representing up-to-date data.\r\nSirius does not, however, build these data structures\r\nitself -- instead, the client application supplies a callback handler,\r\nwhich allows developers using Sirius to build whatever structures are\r\nmost appropriate for their application.\r\n\r\n####Features\r\n* Improved Performance :*Reference datasets fit into a single commodity serverâ€™s RAM.*\r\n* Simplified Architecture :*Allows you to access remote data sets in native data structures.*\r\n* Smooth Operation :*Sirius manages the heavy lifting for distributed systems replication and persistence.*\r\n\r\n\r\n####Links \r\n* [Sirius Wiki](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/wiki)\r\n* [Getting started with Sirius](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/wiki/Getting+started+with+Sirius)\r\n* [Configuring Sirius](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/wiki/Configuring+Sirius)\r\n* [How to deploy Sirius](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/wiki/How+to+deploy+Sirius)\r\n* [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n* [License](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/blob/master/LICENSE)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
