It handles building an absolute ordering\r\nfor updates that arrive in the cluster, ensuring that cluster nodes\r\neventually receive all updates, and persisting the updates on each\r\nnode. These updates are generally used to build in-memory data\r\nstructures on each node, allowing applications using Sirius to have\r\ndirect access to native data structures representing up-to-date data.\r\nSirius does not, however, build these data structures\r\nitself -- instead, the client application supplies a callback handler,\r\nwhich allows developers using Sirius to build whatever structures are\r\nmost appropriate for their application.\r\n\r\nSirius handles building an absolute ordering for updates that arrive \r\nin a cluster of nodes, ensuring that cluster nodes eventually receive \r\nall updates, and persisting the updates on each node. \r\n\r\nUpdates are generally used to build in-memory data structures on each node, \r\nallowing applications using Sirius to have direct access to native data \r\nstructures representing up-to-date data. \r\n\r\nSirius does not, however, build these data structures itself – instead, \r\nthe client application supplies a callback handler, which allows developers \r\nusing Sirius to build whatever structures are most appropriate for their application.\r\n\r\nPutting it another way: Sirius enables a cluster of nodes to keep \r\ndeveloper-controlled in-memory data structures eventually consistent, \r\nallowing I/O-free access to shared information.\r\n\r\n####Features\r\n* Improved Performance :*Reference datasets fit into a single commodity server’s RAM.*\r\n* Simplified Architecture :*Allows you to access remote data sets in native data structures.*\r\n* Smooth Operation :*Sirius manages the heavy lifting for distributed systems replication and persistence.*\r\n\r\n\r\n####Links \r\n* [Sirius Wiki](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/wiki)\r\n* [Getting started with Sirius](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/wiki/Getting+started+with+Sirius)\r\n* [Configuring Sirius](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/wiki/Configuring+Sirius)\r\n* [How to deploy Sirius](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/wiki/How+to+deploy+Sirius)\r\n* [Contributing Guildlines](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n* [License](https://github.com/Comcast/sirius/blob/master/LICENSE)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
