<p>Sirius is an open source distributed system library from Comcast
that provides your application with convenient, low-latency access
to important reference data: small, read-only datasets with
relatively small update rates. As RAM sizes in servers continue their
upward climb, more and more of these datasets will fit in
memory. Enter Sirius.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>Simple, transparent library interface: Arrange your data in
the native data structures of your choice, and let Sirius feed the
updates to your application code.</li>
<li>Eventually consistent replication: Sirius handles
replicating updates&mdash;even across wide-area networks&mdash;in a
consistent order across every member of an application cluster.</li>
<li>Persistence and automated recovery: Sirius stores and
maintains local update logs and uses them to rebuild your in-memory
state after an application restart.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In short, Sirius gives you access to your reference data with
arbitrary, native data structures while handling the distributed system
heavy lifting for you.
